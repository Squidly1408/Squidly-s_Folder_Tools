git clone ...
```
Install the requirements via the reqiurements.py

``` python 
pip install -r requirements.txt

``` python 
main_script_path = os.path.abspath("C:\\Path\\To\\main.py")  # Adjust this as needed
```

## Creator Notes:
Currently this projrct is in the idea phase, a phase where I am currently thinking of and adding quickly differn't things that may be helpful to have in this project. As well as a phase where I am focusing on the potential functionality and use of the app, instead of things like UI and UX. This being said, in the future I plan to re-code and re-design it, to better match theming standards, functionality, and use of this project. As well I am looking at making it an app of its own or making intergrated with-in the windows folder app, for better use of the app.
